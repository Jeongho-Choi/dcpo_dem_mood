Replication Files for Yuehong Cassandra Tai, Yue Hu, & Frederick Solt, "Democracy, Public Support, and Measurement Uncertainty", APSR

The dcpo_demsupport.Rmd file permits replication of the reanalyses reported by Tai, Hu, and Solt.
 
       Here are the data files called by dcpo_demsupport.Rmd: 
            "mood_dem.csv" is the raw data to measure democratic support.  
            "exp_claassen_input.rda" is the expanded data that used in measuring democratic support and generated by 
                           R/argon/dcpo_demsupport/R/exp_claassen_m5.R, which calls 
                           mood_dem.csv. 
                           Note that to setup input raw data, one needs raw survey datasets.
                           See details at https://github.com/fsolt/DCPOtools

	     correct_cls_ajps.rda and correct_cls_apsr.rda are analysis data for replicating original data with uncertainty. 
                 These two files can be generated by 
		     R/analysisData.R, which calls
                         there files: raw_data_controls.RData,claassen_replication_input and claassen_replication_output.rda 
                             raw_data_controls.RData includes raw data for creating variables used in analysis. 
			     claassen_replication_input and claassen_replication_output.rda, which can be generated using:
		                 R/argon/dcpo_demsupport/R/claassen_m5_rep.R
             
             expcor_cls_ajps.rda and expcor_cls_apsr.rda are analysis data using expanded data and with uncertainty.
                 These two files can be generated by 
		     R/analysisData.R, which calls
                         there files: raw_data_controls.RData, exp_claassen_input.rda and exp_claassen_output.rda.
			     exp_claassen_input.rda and exp_claassen_output.rda, which can be generated using:
			         R/argon/dcpo_demsupport/R/exp_claassen_m5.R

             dcpo_ajps.rda and dcpo_apsr.rda are analysis data that include new measures by applying 
                 Dynamic Comparative Public Opinion measurement model (DCPO) to expanded data, and with uncertainty.
                 These two files can be generated by 
                      R/analysisData.R, which calls
                          there files: raw_data_controls.RData, exp_dcpo_input.rda and exp_dcpo_outpu.rda.
                             exp_dcpo_input.rda and exp_dcpo_outpu.rda, which can be generated using:
	   		         R/argon/dcpo_demsupport/R/exp_dcpo.R


Scripts for creating output of democratic support were run on the University of Iowa's high-performance computing cluster.
The working environment requires R version 3.5.1,Rcpp_1.0.0, DCPO, DCPOtools, and rstan_2.18.2.
Note: it will take a couple of days to run measurement models to estimate public support for democracy, if you want to fully replicate the measurement from scratch.
